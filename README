School: University of Nebraska, Lincoln
Purpose:
Designed a robot that could charge itself using RF communication and infrared LED detection and ultrasonic distance calculation.
Robot communicates with a USB-attached XBee to a computer that transmits commands to the robot, such as scan, stop, or repeat.
Sensors send back information including transmitting beacon and alignment beacon angle readings and approximate distances.
Car speed and turning behavior are modified upon approach to the charging station.  Within 6 inches of making contact,
the robot significantly lowers its speed and allows fishtailing to improve turning and reliability.
